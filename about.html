		<p>We're all about learning. That's the whole point of Growth Maestros. Hopefully you not only find growth marketing useful for work but actually interesting too. Whether the goal of your company is to make lots of money and/or to impact lots of lives, growth techniques help make it happen. </p>

		<p>In Italian the word 'Maestro' means both 'master' and 'teacher'.  In this way it's perfect.  It's essential that we source our information directly from the masters, the people who work on growth day in, day out. And then we share this knowledge - teach it - to those who want to improve. </p>

		<p>I'd like to introduce myself and explain why I started this blog. I'm Greg Aubert and I've been reading digital marketing articles for years trying to learn as much as possible.  After a while I noticed the benefits start to taper off. Things I read were oddly similar to articles I'd seen elsewhere. Or I'd click an interesting title, only to find a thin piece of writing behind it. I can boil this down to a couple of reasons: </p>
			<ul class="text-ul">
				<li>Most articles are posted with profit as priority.</li>
				<li>It's harder to write original, deep content.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
		The rise of inbound marketing means the internet is being flooded by articles written by companies trying to acquire users. Almost everyone in the digital marketing space is doing content and putting energy into promoting it. This could have been great were it not for point two. Because it's hard to write original, in-depth pieces, what tends to happen is they repackage what already exists. The writer (often a more junior team member) researches the topic, pulls together information from a bunch of other blogs and hits publish. We get an echo chamber with just a few thought leaders producing fresh material. 
		</p>
		<p>The aim is for Growth Maestros to be better than this. I'm convinced that the best articles are the ones that haven't been written yet. They're waiting in the minds of the growth marketers who have little incentive to write them and are probably too busy doing their work.  I'm putting the time into this knowing that it'll almost certainly never become a source of profit. But that's ok! I'm keen to discover this knowledge for myself and I'm positive that there's people out there who'd be interested too. These are the people who want to become (or perhaps currently are) a world-class growth marketer.  </p>

		<p>I was thinking how to sum up the ethos of Growth Maestros in a few snappy points. Turns out, all I needed was one: </p>
		<p><span class="span-bold span-underlined">Quality above all else.</span>  This means going straight to the source for new information, rather than copying other blogs. It means questioning things to unearth hidden insights and writing deep articles - even though it's harder. And it means publishing only when a post is ready and worthy, not because it's Tuesday and that's when new posts usually go out.</p>
		<p>If you have any thoughts or suggestions I'd be very happy to hear them. My email address is:</p>
		<p>If you'd like to get the latest posts then I encourage you to sign up. It goes without saying that there'll be no spam. You'll hear from me relatively infrequently, only when there's something worth saying.</p>
		<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you find the site useful!<br>
		- Greg</p>
